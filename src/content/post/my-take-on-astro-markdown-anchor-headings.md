Anchor headings are a great way to bookmark or share a specific section in an article. This is why this was one of the first features I wanted to add to my blog - built with [AstroJs](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) (the one you are currently reading ðŸ˜€). Googling for a simple way to achieve this, I did come by several existing solutions. However, for the time being, none of these managed to get the exact result I was aiming at.
In the end, I came up with a very simple vanilla-js solution which did the trick.

## Requirements list:

Before stating to look for a solution, there were a few things I knew I wanted this feature to include.

- The headings should be clickable links. Clicking on them should link to the relevant url path in the article.
- Hovering the headings should reveal a link icon to the left of the heading.
- This should support the headings in the markdown files in my blog.
- Clicking the headings should smoothly scroll the heading to the top of the page.

## The BlogPost.astro component:

My project includes a `BlogPost.astro` component. This components is responsible for the general layout and functionality of my posts and it is the one which wraps my markdown content. I figured that I could probably add some simple javascript to make the headings in the markdown content anchor links.


```astro
---
import BaseLayout from "./Base.astro";
... 

---

<script>
  // markdown linkable headings javascript should go here
</script>

<BaseLayout>
        ... 
		<article>
			<slot />
		</article>
        ...
</BaseLayout>

```

## The implementation

And indeed, adding these few lines to the script tag did the trick: 

```js
const linkSvg = ` 
<svg 
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" 
    class="inline-block h-6 w-6 absolute bottom-0 -left-6 top-1.5" 
    aria-hidden="true" 
    focusable="false" 
    viewBox="0 0 24 24" 
    stroke-width="1" stroke="currentColor" 
    fill="none" 
    stroke-linecap="round" 
    stroke-linejoin="round">
        <path d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z">
</svg>
`;

const anchorHeadings = document.querySelectorAll("h2, h3, h4, h5, h6");

	[...anchorHeadings]
		.forEach((heading) => {
			const anchor = document.createElement("a");
			anchor.className = "group relative cursor-pointer";
			anchor.href = `#${heading.id}`;
			heading.parentNode!.insertBefore(anchor, heading);
			const linkIcon = document.createElement("div");
			linkIcon.className = "hidden group-hover:block";

			linkIcon.innerHTML = linkSvg;
			anchor.appendChild(linkIcon);
			anchor.appendChild(heading);
		});
```

Let's break this down: 

First I'm grabbing all the headings in the post using this line: 

```js
const anchorHeadings = document.querySelectorAll("h2, h3, h4, h5, h6");
```

Notice I'm not selecting `h1` - that's because I didn't want my main blog-post title to be an linkable anchor link.

Next, I'm iterating over the selected heading using `forEach`. For each heading I'm using
